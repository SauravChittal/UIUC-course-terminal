#### Download the code and place the file inside your `\usr\local\bin` location inside your directories(if you don't have those, you will have to change the location variable, and place it within your PATH location).

#### After that, type `class (Subject) (Course Number)` in your terminal and it'll open up the course explorer for that specific course.

#### For example, typing `class CS 374` would open up [CS 374](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2022/spring/CS/374) in your default browser.
